# Obstacle-Game
This is my first game. Just a MVP, as i learned more about Unity, i will add more features.
Simply move the player without crashing into obstacles.


## TODO 

- [ ] Finish Condition (When the player arrives the other end finish the game
- [ ] Show Score ( score is calculated by time and nbr of obstacles crushed)
- [ ] Adjustable Speed ( To adjust difficulty)
- [ ] Collect Points (Maybe player can buy upgrades)
- [ ] Add different platforms and players.
